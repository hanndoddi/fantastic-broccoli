<h1>fantastic broccoli</h1>
<p>Broccoli resulted from breeding of landrace Brassica crops in the northern Mediterranean starting in about the sixth century BC.[6] Broccoli has its origins in primitive cultivars grown in the Roman Empire and was most likely improved via artificial selection in the southern Italian Peninsula or in Sicily.[7][8][9] Broccoli was spread to northern Europe by the 18th century and brought to North America in the 19th century by Italian immigrants.[8] After the Second World War, breeding of United States and Japanese F1 hybrids increased yields, quality, growth speed, and regional adaptation, which produced the cultivars that have been the most popular since then: 'Premium Crop', 'Packman', and 'Marathon'.</p>
